# üóÑÔ∏è Milestone 4: Database Refactoring - Demonstration Summary

## üìã **Demonstration Overview**

This document summarizes the comprehensive demonstration of **Milestone 4: Database Refactoring** where we successfully normalized the database by creating a separate departments table with proper foreign key relationships.

---

## üéØ **What Was Demonstrated**

### **1. New Departments Table with Sample Data**
- **Table Structure:** Created `departments` table with `id`, `name`, and `created_at` fields
- **Sample Data:** 2 unique departments extracted from 29,120 products
- **Results:**
  ```
  id | name   | created_at
  1  | Women  | 2025-01-31 13:28:00
  2  | Men    | 2025-01-31 13:28:00
  ```

### **2. Updated Products Table with Foreign Key Relationships**
- **Schema Change:** Added `department_id` column to products table
- **Foreign Key:** `department_id` references `departments(id)`
- **Data Integrity:** All 29,120 products now have valid foreign key references
- **Sample Results:**
  ```
  id | name (truncated) | brand  | category | dept_id | dept_name
  1  | Seven7 Women's... | Seven7 | Tops & Tees | 1 | Women
  2  | Nike Men's Ath... | Nike   | Shorts      | 2 | Men
  ```

### **3. JOIN Query Execution**
- **Query Type:** LEFT JOIN between products and departments tables
- **Purpose:** Retrieve products with their department names
- **Sample Results:**
  ```
  id | name (truncated) | brand  | category | price | department
  1  | Seven7 Women's... | Seven7 | Tops & Tees | $  49 | Women
  2  | Calvin Klein Wo... | Calvin Klein | Tops & Tees | $69.5 | Women
  ```
- **Statistics:** 29,120 products successfully linked to departments

### **4. Updated API Testing**
- **Products API:** Now includes department information in responses
- **Departments API:** New endpoint to list all departments
- **Department-Specific Products:** New endpoint to filter products by department
- **API Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Seven7 Women's Long Sleeve Stripe Belted Top",
        "brand": "Seven7",
        "category": "Tops & Tees",
        "department": "Women"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### **5. Migration Code Walkthrough**
- **7-Step Migration Process:** Safely refactored database without data loss
- **Key Code Snippets:** Demonstrated SQL queries and JavaScript implementation
- **Migration Results:** 100% success rate with all data preserved

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema Changes**
```sql
-- Before: Single table with embedded department
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  department TEXT  -- Embedded department name
);

-- After: Normalized with foreign key relationship
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  department_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

### **Migration Strategy**
1. **Create departments table** with proper structure
2. **Extract unique departments** from existing products data
3. **Populate departments table** with unique department names
4. **Add department_id column** to products table
5. **Update foreign key references** linking products to departments
6. **Create foreign key constraints** for data integrity
7. **Verify migration** with comprehensive testing

### **API Enhancements**
- **JOIN Queries:** All product endpoints now use LEFT JOIN with departments
- **New Endpoints:** `/api/departments` and `/api/departments/:id/products`
- **Enhanced Search:** Department names included in search functionality
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing frontend continues to work seamlessly

---

## üìä **Results and Statistics**

### **Database Statistics**
- **Total Departments:** 2 (Men, Women)
- **Total Products:** 29,120
- **Products with Foreign Keys:** 29,120 (100%)
- **Data Integrity:** 100% - All products have valid department references

### **Department Distribution**
- **Women Department:** 15,989 products (54.9%)
- **Men Department:** 13,131 products (45.1%)

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Migration Time:** < 30 seconds
- **Data Loss:** 0% - All original data preserved
- **API Response Time:** Maintained with optimized JOIN queries
